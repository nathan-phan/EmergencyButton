<h2>Description</h2>
Emergency Button is a security app which, upon activated, will send an emergency text with location included to a list of contacts after a
certain amount of time passed without user intervention. 

This is a hybrid app coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then ported into an android app using Cordova. It is still in development process
, may contain bugs and not intended for real life usage (yet).
